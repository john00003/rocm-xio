# QID quiesce ISOLATION stress test.
#
# Purpose: prove that rocm-xio's per-hctx quiesce (ROCM_XIO_QUIESCE_NS in
# HCTX mode -> blk_mq_stop_hw_queue) is SURGICAL and REVERSIBLE:
#
#   1. ISOLATION   while the target QID's hctx is quiesced, an I/O pinned
#                  to that QID's CPU is queued by blk-mq but NOT
#                  dispatched -- it must NOT complete.
#   2. CROSS-CPU   during that same window, I/O pinned to a DIFFERENT
#      LIVENESS    CPU (a different hctx) MUST complete normally. This
#                  proves only the target hctx stopped and the kernel /
#                  rest of the device is healthy (not an over-broad
#                  full-queue quiesce, not a wedged controller).
#   3. RESUME      after the window ends (hold-quiesce unquiesces and
#                  exits), the previously-blocked I/O completes, its data
#                  verifies byte-for-byte, and dmesg is clean.
#
# === Why the window is held by ONE long-lived process ===
# The module auto-restarts a quiesced hctx the instant the controlling
# /dev/rocm-xio fd closes (crash-safety in rocm_xio_release()). A
# fire-and-exit quiesce-qid therefore holds the queue stopped for only
# ~10 microseconds -- useless as a test window. Instead we run the
# `hold-quiesce <bdev> <qid> <seconds>` helper in the BACKGROUND: it
# opens /dev/rocm-xio, issues QUIESCE_NS, prints "held:", sleeps for the
# whole window keeping the fd open, then UNQUIESCE_NS + exits. The
# quiesce is active for exactly the sleep duration.
#
# === Why the isolation assertion has teeth ===
# A 256 KiB write to a warmed hctx is near-instant (sub-millisecond) when
# it is NOT blocked. The background CPU-target write touches a SENTINEL
# file ONLY on completion. We assert the sentinel is still ABSENT while we
# have INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMED the target hctx is still STOPPED (reading
# the blk-mq hctx state file) and the hold-quiesce process is still alive:
# if the write were dispatched it would have finished in milliseconds, so
# an absent sentinel while the queue is provably stopped is robust proof
# the hctx is holding it off. After the hold, the sentinel MUST appear
# (resume), and the written region MUST match the pattern (integrity).
# A broken unquiesce (queue stays stopped) makes the post-window write
# never complete -> FAIL. A broken/over-broad quiesce (control CPU also
# stalls) -> FAIL. Either way the test catches a broken module.
